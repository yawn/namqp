h1. Introduction

nampq is a low-level driver for AMQP using the "NIO":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_I/O framework "netty":http://www.jboss.org/netty. Currently it supports all non-deprecated AMQP 0-8 operations and targets RabbitMQ as a broker. 

h2. What it is / isn't / could be 

* It's basic and lowlevel (read: there is no API, just the protocol handling is in place).
* It's simple and (hopefully) easy to understand.
* I have not (yet) used it in production.
* Due to the stack ripping inherent to (most) evented architectures the resulting programs might not be as intuititive as synchronous implementations - your mileage may vary.
* There is no error handling that deserves it's name in place yet.
* Forks welcome!

h2. Next steps

* Write an API.
* Change the typebase to ChannelBuffer instead of Java types.
